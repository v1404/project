            </p>

            <p>    2:Positioning: The patient is usually positioned on their left side, and a lubricated instrument called a proctoscope or sigmoidoscope is gently inserted into the rectum for visualization.</p>
                
            <p>        3:Biopsy Instrumentation: A biopsy forceps or similar instrument is introduced through the proctoscope, allowing the surgeon to grasp and remove small tissue samples from the rectal lining.

            </p>
                
            <p>    4:Tissue Collection: Multiple small tissue samples (biopsies) are taken from different areas of the rectum to ensure a comprehensive examination.
